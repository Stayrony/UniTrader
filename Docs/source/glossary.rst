   Trader
   Traders
     A person who performs trading operations.

   Trading
     Buying or selling of goods and services among countries called commerce. Forex Trading is the trading of Foreign Currencies.

   Candlestick Chart
     A chart that indicates the trading range for the day as well as the opening and closing price. If the open price is higher than the close price, the rectangle between the open and close price is shaded. If the close price is higher than the open price, that area of the chart is not shaded. **Charts tell traders where the market is potentially going.**

   Currency
     Any form of money issued by a government or central bank and used as legal tender and a basis for trade.

     Currency conversion in the foreign exchange market: is necessary to complete private and commercial transactions across borders; a tourist needs to pay expenses on the road in local currency. A firm: buys/sells goods and services in the other countryâ€™s local currency; uses the foreign exchange market to invest excess funds. **Currency is used to speculate on currency movements.**

   Balance
     The balance in trading account.

   Stop and Limit
     The primary benefit of a stop-limit order is that the trader has precise control over when the order should be filled. The downside, as with all limit orders, is that the trade is not guaranteed to be executed if the stock/commodity does not reach the stop price.

     A stop order is an order that becomes executable once a set price has been reached and is then filled at the current market price. A limit order is one that is at a certain price or better. By combining the two orders, the investor has much greater precision in executing the trade. Because a stop order is filled at the market price after the stop price has been hit, it's possible that you could get a really bad fill in fast-moving markets.

   Pips
     Digits added to or subtracted from the fourth decimal place, i.e. 0.0001. Also called Points.

   Open a position
     A deal not yet reversed or settled with a physical payment. an operation (transaction) to register (activate) the trade.
